<!-- In CSS, we have two types of fonts- web-safe fonts and web fonts. Web saved fonts are the fonts that come pre-installed with most of the operating systems, therefore, using these fonts you will never encounter any error. But on the other hand, some fonts are not shipped with the OS; so to use them, we need to import them from the web.

We can also use the technique of font stack. A font stack is a list of fonts that are listed in order of preference you would like them to appear in case some fonts are not loading. The example of this is shown below-
    p {font-family:'Ubuntu', 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;}

Font Size is used to set the size of a font. In the above example, we used our font size to be 33px. Pixel ‘px’ is the unit of the font size and it is 1/96th of an inch.
                font-size: 23px; 

The next property is line-height. Line-height is the spacing between the fonts (current font and previous font).
                line-height: 1.8em;

Next property is font-weight. The font weight property sets how thick or thin character in text should be displayed.    
                font-weight: bold;
