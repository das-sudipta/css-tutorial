<!-- CSS gives style to raw HTML..       
It stands for Cascading Style Sheets..
CSS is used to give style to our web pages..
CSS is used to make websites responsive.Responsive means that the site will behave accordingly to the different screen sizes..
CSS takes the responsibility of design in your website..


The syntax of CSS is-
                     P { color: blue; }
P stands for the selector and it decides which part of the HTML the CSS will be applied. It states where the CSS property is to be applied.
Property is used to describe which property you want to change or add. Whether you have to change colour, border, background, width, all these come under property. 
The last section is for defining the value. All the properties will be changed according to the value we provide.

We can also target multiple properties at one time. The syntax is as follows-
        header, p.intro { background-color: red;
                              border-radius: 3px,
                         }
In the above example, we have changed the header tag and the paragraph tag with a class intro to change the background colour to red and border-radius to 3 pixels.
