<!-- After running your code, if you will right-click anywhere in the browser then you will see an inspect element option. By clicking on it you will be able to see the original code. From here you can make some changes in the webpage and can observe it. However, it does not change the original code on your server. Developer Tools are used to make any changes into your code and see the instant effect on your web page. This change is not a permanent.

Some tips while defining a color class:--
>> Do not directly use the name of the color as the class name instead use 
        colorprimary 
        colorsuccess
        colorwarning
As writing these looks more professional and also helps in future to maintain our codes.
