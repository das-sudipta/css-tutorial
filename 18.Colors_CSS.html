<!-- 1.>> The first method of defining the colour in the CSS is directly writing the particular colour name.
2.>>  The second way of defining colour is with the help of ‘RGB,’ as shown below. The RGB colour range varies from 0 to 255.
3.>>  The third way is by giving hex colours. However, it is very rarely used. -->
